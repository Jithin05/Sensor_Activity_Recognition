# Sensor Activity Recognition

### Description
This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.

This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.

The feature matrix contains 561 columns and the data was divided into trainset and testset each with 7352 and 2947 rows respectively.

I tried different ML models like Logistc Regression, Linear SVC, Decision tree, Random forest and also LSTM model for classification task.
